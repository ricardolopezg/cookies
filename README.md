Create a simple front-end website where users can decide how many cookies that they'd like to eat of each flavor. Once they indicate this, which could be by clicking on an item on screen or by submitted a form, store this value inside of several browser cookies, which specify the type of confectionary cookies as the key and the amount of confectionary cookies eaten so far as a value.

A user should be able to:

* Grab a cookie flavor, which increments their cookie count by one
* Come back to the page and see how many cookies they've grabbed so far
* Clear their cookie count completely in case they're feeling guilty
